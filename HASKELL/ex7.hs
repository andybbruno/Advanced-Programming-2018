Write a function countVowelPali that given a list of strings xs returns the total number of vowels in strings that are palindromes. For example,
countVowelPali ["anna", "banana", "civic", "mouse"] = 4
Goal: Fun with strings and lists (again :P).
Expected output: Two implementations of countVowelPali: one recursive and one using the combinators map, filter, foldl/r from the Haskell Prelude.
